# LLLoader
An executable capable of calling LoadLibrary via CreateRemoteThread in the specified remote process to load an x86 DLL of our choice.

 No x64 capabilities as of yet (that I know of).
 
To enable x64 dll injection capabilities you'd just need to replace certain types with their x64 counterparts. If you want to you can submit a pull reqest doing this.
